- **Purpose**: Databases are designed to manage large amounts of information by allowing users to create, read, update, and delete data efficiently. They serve as a backbone for applications that require data storage and retrieval.

### 1.1 Importance of Databases
- **Data Management**: Databases provide a systematic way to store, retrieve, and manage data, making it easier to handle large volumes of information.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures accuracy and consistency of data over its lifecycle, which is crucial for decision-making.
- **Data Security**: Protects sensitive information through access controls, encryption, and backup mechanisms.
- **Multi-User  Access**: Allows multiple users to access and manipulate data simultaneously without conflicts, which is essential for collaborative environments.

## 2. Types of Databases
Databases can be classified into several types based on their structure and usage:

### 2.1 Relational Databases
- **Definition**: Relational databases store data in tables (relations) with predefined relationships between them. Each table consists of rows and columns.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Data is organized in rows (records) and columns (attributes).
  - Uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for data manipulation and querying.
  - Supports ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) to ensure reliable transactions.
- **Examples**:
  - **MySQL**: An open-source relational database management system widely used for web applications.
  - **Oracle Database**: A commercial relational database known for its robustness and scalability.

### 2.2 NoSQL Databases
- **Definition**: Non-relational databases designed for unstructured data and large-scale data storage. They provide flexible schemas and can handle various data types.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Schema-less design allows for easy modifications and scalability.
  - Can store data in formats such as key-value pairs, documents, or graphs.
- **Examples**:

- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Database Schema**: The blueprint of the database, defining tables, fields, data types, and relationships. It serves as a guide for how data is organized.
  - **Normalization**: The process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller, related tables and defining relationships between them.
  
### 4.1 Normalization
- **Purpose**: To eliminate data redundancy and ensure data dependencies make sense.
- **Normal Forms**:
  - **First Normal Form (1NF)**: Ensures that all columns contain atomic values and each record is unique.
  - **Second Normal Form (2NF)**: Achieves 1NF and ensures that all non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on the primary key.
  - **Third Normal Form (3NF)**: Achieves 2NF and ensures that all attributes are only dependent on the primary key.
  
#### Example of Normalization:
- **Unnormalized Table**:
  | StudentID | StudentName | Course1 | Course2 |
  |-----------|-------------|---------|---------|
  | 1         | Alice       | Math    | Science |
  | 2         | Bob         | Math    | NULL    |

- **Normalized Tables**:
  - **Students Table**:
    | StudentID | StudentName |
    |-----------|-------------|
    | 1         | Alice       |
    | 2         | Bob         |
  
  - **Courses Table**:

    |----------|------------|
    | 1        | Math       |
    | 2        | Science    |
  
  - **Enrollments Table**:
    | StudentID | CourseID |
    |-----------|----------|
    | 1         | 1        |
    | 1         | 2        |
    | 2         | 1        |

## 7. Data Integrity
- **Definition**: Data integrity refers to the accuracy and consistency of data within a database.
- **Types of Data Integrity**:
  - **Entity Integrity**: Ensures that each entity has a unique identifier (primary key) and that no two records can have the same primary key value.
  - **Referential Integrity**: Ensures that relationships between tables remain consistent. For example, if a student is deleted from the Students table, all related records in the Enrollments table should also be removed to maintain referential integrity.
  - **Domain Integrity**: Ensures that all values in a column fall within a defined set of valid values (e.g., a column for age should only contain positive integers).

## 8. Conclusion
