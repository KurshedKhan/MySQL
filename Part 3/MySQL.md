- **GROUP BY**: Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows.
  - **Example**: `SELECT CourseID, COUNT(*) FROM Enrollments GROUP BY CourseID;` counts the number of students enrolled in each course.

## 7. Data Integrity
- **Definition**: Data integrity refers to the accuracy and consistency of data within a database. It ensures that data remains correct and reliable over time.
- **Types of Data Integrity**:
  - **Entity Integrity**: Ensures that each entity has a unique identifier (primary key) and that no two records can have the same primary key value.
  - **Referential Integrity**: Ensures that relationships between tables remain consistent. For example, if a student is deleted from the Students table, all related records in the Enrollments table should also be removed to maintain referential integrity.
  - **Domain Integrity**: Ensures that all values in a column fall within a defined set of valid values (e.g., a column for age should only contain positive integers).

## 8. Conclusion
